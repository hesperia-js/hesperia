# Contributing

## Getting started

Use Bun to install dependencies and run the development tools:

```sh
bun install
bun install --cwd editors/vscode
bun run build
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run lint
bun run fmt:check
```

Build before typechecking: consumer checks resolve the package's emitted
declarations in `dist/`. `bun run check` performs that build first, then runs
typechecking, lint, formatting checks, the deterministic suites, and browser tests.

Use `bun run fmt -- <paths>` to format the files you change. Keep unrelated
work intact, including files in the neighboring Aeolia repository.

## Where code belongs

The compiler in `src/compiler/` owns source analysis, checking views, canonical
representation, and code generation. The browser runtime in `src/runtime/` owns
component lifetimes, DOM objects, bindings, structural changes, and effect order.
`src/client.ts` connects authored operations to their component owner.
`src/routing/` owns route matching and browser navigation. `src/editor/` adapts
the compiler's checking views to editor requests; the VS Code client lives in
`editors/vscode/`.

Data adaptation belongs in `src/data/`; Aeolia owns the underlying reactive
engine and shared stores. Hesperia must use Aeolia's public interfaces. Project
commands, browser bundling, and local servers belong in `src/tooling/` and must
stay outside browser application bundles.

Before changing behavior, consult `docs/implementation-milestone.md` and its
source references. Preserve accepted decisions across compiler, runtime, types,
and tests. A test written around a different behavior does not approve that change.

Before planning package moves, optional integrations, or next-milestone
dependencies, read [the next milestone constraints](docs/next-milestone.md).

## Tests

Prefer integration tests of public behavior and complete application workflows.
For a bug fix, write the smallest scenario that would have caught the bug.
Check the wrong result, not just whether the code ran.

Keep lifecycle distinctions intact when consolidating tests: a live store is
not equivalent to an unobserved one, and a warmed computed is not equivalent to
one that has never been read. Use strict equality for emitted-value sequences
where absence and a real `undefined` must be distinguished.

Use fake time for freshness and collection, not synchronous signal propagation.
Prefer observable completion over sleeps or guessed microtask counts. Keep
manual profiling outside the deterministic suite.

Aim for complete meaningful coverage, with a 90% minimum unless a lower result
has an explicit, reviewed justification. Bun currently reports line and function
coverage; branch coverage is not measured. Percentages do not replace behavioral
assertions.

See [test ownership and commands](tests/README.md). Run focused tests while
working, then the complete suite. Consumer-type fixtures and package-artifact
tests must continue to check the emitted public package, not only source imports.

## Documentation and review

Document public functions, types, options, callbacks, and lifecycle behavior
with TSDoc. Explain what the signature cannot: ownership, timing, cancellation,
equality, failure, and cleanup. Keep examples small and type-correct.

Keep the README introductory. Put user-facing behavioral detail in `docs/`
and contributor guidance here. Prefer concrete prose and useful variable names.
Comments should explain a non-obvious constraint, not repeat the next line.

Before handing over a change, run formatting, lint, typecheck, and the full test
suite. After public API or TSDoc changes, inspect the emitted declarations too.
State any checks that failed or could not run; do not describe a partial check
as a clean result.

Automated contributors must also follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Contribution licensing

The Software's public source is licensed under [MPL-2.0](COPYING). The project also
plans to offer alternative commercial licenses, as described in
[the commercial agreement](LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md).

Contributors retain ownership of their contributions. The contributor agreement
below authorizes Werberth Lins, the project licensor, upon acceptance, to include
contributions in public MPL and alternative commercial releases.

Only grant rights you own or are authorized to grant. If your employer or another
party owns the contribution, acceptance must come from someone authorized to act
for that rights holder. Disclose third-party material and its license; submitting
it does not give the project additional rights to that material.

### Recording CLA acceptance

Each contributor must explicitly accept the CLA by checking an acceptance box
in the pull request description. The statement must identify the agreement
version, link to an immutable copy of its full terms, and confirm that the
contributor owns the necessary rights or is authorized by the rights holder to
grant them. Leave the box unchecked by default; maintainers must not check it
on a contributor's behalf.

Before merging, maintainers must verify and retain the acceptance record and
the referenced agreement version. A PR author's acceptance does not cover
other contributors' rights without their authorization; obtain the necessary
acceptance for each rights holder whose work requires the grant.

Retain the contributor's acceptance text, its timestamp and account, the
identified agreement version, and the covered contribution revision. For an
organization-owned contribution, verify and retain evidence that the accepting
representative may grant the required rights. Do not merge while ownership or
authority remains unresolved. A commit signature or company email address alone
does not establish authority to grant an organization's intellectual-property
rights.

### Contributor License Agreement

#### C1. Parties, contribution, and acceptance

This agreement is between Werberth Lins (the project licensor) and the individual
or organization identified as the contributor in the acceptance record. An
organization accepts through a representative authorized to grant these rights.
Ownership is not inferred solely from the identity of the GitHub account.

**Software** means the software project identified in the root LICENSE of the
repository in which the project licensor publishes this agreement. The
acceptance record identifies that repository and the covered pull request.
Copying the agreement or moving a repository does not expand the grant to
unrelated software or contributions.

A contribution is the code or documentation intentionally submitted for inclusion
in Software in the identified pull request, including revisions expressly covered
by the contributor's acceptance. This agreement does not cover unrelated work,
private repositories, or contributions to other projects. Later pull requests require
their own acceptance. Material identified as belonging to another rights holder
is not included in this grant without that holder's authorization.

Acceptance requires an affirmative statement in the pull request identifying
the agreement version and an immutable link to it.
That statement must identify the covered contribution and the rights holder on
whose behalf it is made. Publication of a PR alone is not acceptance. The project
retains the acceptance record and agreement version; sensitive identity or
employer-authorization evidence need not be posted in the public PR.

#### C2. Ownership and copyright permission

You retain ownership of your contribution and may use your own work elsewhere.
You grant the project licensor a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license for the duration of the applicable copyright to reproduce, modify,
incorporate, display, perform, distribute, and sublicense your contribution and
adaptations as part of Software. This includes both MPL-2.0 releases and releases
under alternative commercial terms, including proprietary distribution without
the source-availability requirements of MPL. The permission includes sublicensing
through authorized commercial licensing representatives and to customers within
their Software licenses; it does not transfer your ownership to those parties.

This permission is intended to be irrevocable to the extent allowed by law,
subject to this agreement. You receive no royalties or share of commercial license
fees under this agreement. The licensor's commercial support promises impose no
maintenance or customer-support duty on you.

Contributions incorporated into the public Software project remain available under
MPL-2.0. Neither this agreement nor a commercial sublicense withdraws MPL rights
already granted in public releases.

#### C3. Notices and authorship

For authorized alternative commercial distributions, you permit omission of
license and copyright notices relating to your contribution to the extent you
may lawfully authorize it, and allow the licensor to pass on that permission.
Public MPL distributions remain subject to MPL notice requirements. This clause
does not authorize false authorship claims, waive non-waivable rights, or waive
third-party notices. It grants no trademark rights.

This permission does not extinguish an author's right to claim authorship or
remove attribution required by applicable law, including for documentation or
other material governed by rules different from those for computer programs.
A public contribution record does not replace legally required attribution in
a distribution.

#### C4. Contribution-specific patents

For use of the contribution as part of Software, you grant the project licensor
royalty-free permission under patent claims you control that are necessarily
practiced by the contribution alone or combined with Software
as submitted. The grant permits making, using, selling, importing, and distributing
that implementation for the life of those claims, with permission to sublicense
through Software's applicable public or commercial license, including through the
authorized commercial licensing representatives described in C2.

Recipients receive patent permissions under their applicable Software license.
Commercial recipients' permissions are subject to that commercial agreement's
scope, duration, termination, and expressly surviving recipient rights. This
agreement does not give them a separate patent license for the life of the claims
or extend their commercial coverage. Independent grants under MPL-2.0 remain
governed by MPL-2.0.

This grant supplies no rights under unrelated patents or third-party patents
and does not cover infringement caused solely by later changes
or combinations outside that submitted implementation. It is not a guarantee that
Software is free of third-party patent claims.

#### C5. Authority, third-party material, and support

You confirm that you own the contribution or have authority to grant the rights
in this agreement. If an employer or another person owns any relevant rights,
obtain the necessary authorization before accepting. Identify third-party material,
its source, applicable licenses, and restrictions known to you. Notify the project
if you learn that your authority or disclosures were materially inaccurate.

Except for those representations and obligations imposed by law, contributions
are provided as is, without promises of error-free operation or fitness for a
particular application. You undertake no support commitment and no contractual
obligation to defend or indemnify the licensor or its customers. Mandatory rights
and obligations remain unaffected. The project is not obliged to merge a PR.

These disclaimers do not excuse a false statement of ownership or authority,
breach of the express representations in this agreement, or liability imposed
by applicable law. They create no separate duty to conduct or fund another
party's defense.

#### C6. Versions and applicable law

Changes to this agreement require fresh acceptance for the affected contribution;
editing CONTRIBUTING does not retroactively change earlier grants. This agreement
does not replace a customer's commercial license or impose its payment obligations
on contributors. It is governed by Brazilian law with disputes submitted to the
competent courts in Brazil, subject to mandatory jurisdiction and protections
that cannot be displaced by agreement. An unenforceable term is ineffective to
the extent required by law; the remaining terms continue where legally possible.
